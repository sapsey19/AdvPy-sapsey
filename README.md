  - Hangman
    - Simple Hangman game. Selects a random word from a list of around 40 unique words. To play, simply run the file and enter 1 character to guess. The program doesn't allow for multicharacter inputs or for users to use characters more than once. The word to guess is shown as dashes('-'). When a player correctly guesses a letter, that letter(s) is revealed. Prints out ascii art for each stage of the game, and keeps track of all used letters both correct and incorrect. After the game is over, the program allows users to play again, or quit.
